# Janus Sphere Innovations (JSI)
### "The Linux of Medical Imaging"

## Vision
To end breast cancer through ultra-low-dose, high-specificity imaging. By replacing mechanical gantries with **electronically steerable X-rays**, we enable frequent, safe, and targeted screening for all.

## Core Technology: RBYRCT
Ray-by-Ray Computed Tomography (RBYRCT) is an adaptive framework that:
- **Reduces Radiation:** Achieves reliable 3mm lesion detection with 64% less dose than conventional CT.
- **Concentrates Dose:** Delivers 4.58x more radiation to the Region of Interest (ROI) than surrounding tissue.
- **Leverages Janus Spheres:** 11-layer dual-material spheres provide rapid, electronic beam steering without moving parts.

## Repository Structure
- `/src/components`: UI for investor dashboard and technical demonstrations.
- `/src/hooks`: Real-time state management for the adaptive steering loop.
- `/public/papers`: High-fidelity research documents (JAIR, STRX).
